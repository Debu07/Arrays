An Array is a collection of items of similar data types stored at
continous memory location.

This makes easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to the base value.

<strong>data_type array_name[array_size];</strong>

Arrays allow random access of elements. This makes accessing elements by
position faster.

Arays have better <strong> Cache Locality </strong> that can make a pretty big difference in performance.
